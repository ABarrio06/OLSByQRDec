# OLSByQRDec
In this project I aim to solve Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models using QR Decomposition. For doing that, I code three different functions, which perform the aforementioned decomposition, solve linear systems for upper triangular matrices, and use the previous results to identify the coefficients of interest, respectively.
