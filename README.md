# Solving OLS Models Using QR Decomposition
The aim of this project is solving Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models using QR Decomposition. For that purpose, R is used to code three different functions, which perform the aforementioned decomposition, solve linear systems for upper triangular matrices, and use the previous results to identify the coefficients of interest, respectively.
